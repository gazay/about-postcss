Hi, my name is Andrey Sitnik. I am a front-end developer at a company called Evil Martians
and the author of Autoprefixer and PostCSS. As a front-end in my company I've been behind the development of
front-end of Groupon Russia (since the early days to the IPO), OnlineTours.ru and Amplifr.com, a social networking posting and analytics tool.

Let's make a quick poll to kick things off. How many people here do use Stylus? Please raise your hands, come on.
Less?
Sass?
Autoprefixer?

If you've used Autoprefixer, you may already know that it does not work the same way Compass, Bourbon
or any other mixins library does. It has no mixins at all. You just write selectors
and properties and it just works — like magic.

This is because Autoprefixer is only a tip of the iceberg of an entirely new way
to process your CSS. In fact, Autoprefixer is just a plugin for PostCSS, a tool to extend
or even replace CSS preprocessors.

Let's start with a bit of theory. Why do we even need to compile our CSS?
After that I will tell why preprocessors don't solve current web development problems.
Next I will show how PostCSS works and how is it different from using a preprocessor.
And then I'll show some things that are entirely new in the field and became possible
only thanks to the introduction of postprocessors.
And we'll also see if PostCSS is stable enough for production usage.

So, first things first. What ideas are behind PostCSS?

My graduation work at a university was regarding genetic algorithms.
I do actually believe that every long-term development is based on evolution.
We have a great example of biological evolution in nature. We use artificial evolution in our computer science.
And of course you've heard about memes, internet memes — there is even a theory that every popular human idea is a part
of the same evolution process.

At least, it is only a long-term optimization process that mankind knows today.

Evolution is based on three steps. Random mutation. Natural selection
in the wild. And inheritance of the best results.

Do these steps really apply in browser specification process? Of course,
we have a lot of inheritance. And lots of legacy code and specifications.

But do we really have the selection step? Mozilla was forced to support blink tag
for 19 years. It was a non-standard tag working in Firefox only.

Are you afraid to make a mistake, if you will have to support the decision for a decade?
Can

That’s all for now. You can find the project on GitHub.
You can follow development news on Twitter. And check out the site of my company.

Now it is time for your questions.
Please don't hesitate since for every question you ask you will receive a small Russian candy — like this.
